## 1) Academic & Practical Foundations

### 1.1 Evolution at a glance (annotated)

- **Few‑shot/zero‑shot prompting** established *in‑context learning* (ICL): GPT‑3 demonstrated task‑agnostic few‑shot inference without gradient updates. citeturn5search0turn5search6  
- **Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT)**: showing worked steps via exemplars improves complex reasoning in sufficiently large LMs. citeturn4search0turn4search4  
- **Self‑Consistency (SC)**: sample diverse reasoning paths and aggregate the most consistent answer, yielding large gains on reasoning benchmarks. citeturn0search0turn0search4  
- **Structured search with CoT** → **Tree‑of‑Thought (ToT)**: explores multiple reasoning branches with lookahead/backtracking. citeturn4search1turn4search5  
- **Self‑improvement loops**: *Reflexion* (verbal feedback memory) and *Self‑Refine* (iterative self‑critique) reliably lift performance without weight updates. citeturn4search2turn4search7  
- **Alignment & prompting**: instruction‑following via **RLHF** (InstructGPT), plus **DPO** as a simpler, supervised alternative; **Constitutional AI** for rule‑guided harmlessness. citeturn1search1turn1search4turn1search2turn1search5turn1search0  
- **External knowledge via RAG** marries prompts with retrieval to improve factuality and updatability. citeturn0search2turn0search14

## 2) Architecture & Methodology

### 2.1 Prompt management architecture

```
/prompts/
  system/            # system & safety prompts
  tasks/<domain>/    # task prompts (ICL exemplars, variants)
  tools/             # tool-augmented templates (RAG, function-calling)
  meta/              # meta-prompts for APE/ProTeGi/RLPrompt
/evals/
  helm/ promptbench/ gaia/ rag/ lm-harness/
/datasets/           # eval datasets, golden sets, adversarials
/policies/           # safety constraints, refusal rubrics
/experiments/        # YAML runs; seed, decoding, model, data pins
/versioning/         # semver + change logs; migration notes
```

- **Principles:** prompts are versioned artifacts (semver), diff‑friendly (Markdown/JSON), and validated in CI before use. *Every prompt change must ship with eval diffs.* HELM‑style multi‑metric and PromptBench robustness checks are first‑class. citeturn0search7turn3search8

### 2.2 Evaluation mechanisms

- **Quantitative:** task accuracy (exact match/F1), pass@k (for code), calibration, robustness under adversarial prompt attacks, toxicity/bias, and efficiency (latency, cost). HELM formalizes multi‑metric reporting across scenarios. citeturn0search7  
- **Qualitative:** rubric‑based human review; error taxonomy; preference tests (A/B) with statistical tests.  
- **Robustness:** PromptBench stress‑tests with character/word/sentence/semantic perturbations & adversarial instructions. citeturn3search8  
- **Agent/tool eval:** GAIA emphasizes real‑world tasks requiring browsing/tool use; track success & autonomy cost. citeturn3search9  
- **RAG eval:** use RAGAS/ARES for answer faithfulness, context precision/recall, and relevance; maintain golden Q/A with references. citeturn8search5turn8search12

### 2.3 Modular templates & composition
- **Layers:** `{system}{developer}{task}{tools}{user}{policy}{scoring}`; each layer owns distinct constraints and is independently versioned.  
- **Parameterization:** decode policy per prompt (temperature, nucleus/top‑p, top‑k, penalties, beam/n‑best, self‑consistency n).  
- **Composition strategies:** slot‑based ICL exemplars, retrieval‑injected evidence blocks with signed provenance, *MMR* or re‑ranking for diversity/relevance, and verifier prompts for post‑hoc checking. citeturn11search0

## 3) Optimization Techniques

### 3.1 Human‑feedback alignment levers
- **RLHF pipeline** (SFT → RM → PPO) aligns models to instruction following; **DPO** simplifies to a closed‑form policy update via a classification loss. Use these to design system prompts that assume aligned behaviors and to tune prompts against RM‑like criteria in evals. citeturn1search1turn1search4turn1search2  
- **Constitutional AI**: encode values/rules via a “constitution,” use model self‑critique to reduce harmful outputs; informs structure of safety/system prompts. citeturn1search0

### 3.2 Search‑time reasoning
- **CoT + SC**: set `n` samples with varied seeds; aggregate via voting/verifier; enforce evidence‑bound rationales. citeturn0search0  
- **ToT**: breadth/beam over *thoughts* with heuristic scoring (e.g., goal distance, tool cost), backtracking allowed. citeturn4search1

### 3.3 Automatic prompt optimization
- **APE**: meta‑prompt generates candidate instructions; evaluate on validation set; select by metric. citeturn9search0  
- **RLPrompt**: RL over discrete tokens to optimize prompts. citeturn9search1  
- **ProTeGi**: refine with textual gradients (LLM feedback) and beam search. citeturn9search2

### 3.4 Efficiency at inference
- **Context budgeting:** aggressive retrieval filtering, MMR diversification, and exemplar compression. citeturn11search0  
- **Throughput/latency:** batch where safe; adopt speculative decoding and KV‑cache sharing (PagedAttention) when serving your own models; streaming for UX. citeturn6search2turn6search1

## 4) Risk, Safety & Alignment

### 4.1 Threat models for prompts
- **Prompt injection & indirect injection**, data exfiltration, tool‑abuse, unsafe content elicitation, and sandbox escapes in agentic settings. OWASP’s LLM Top‑10 (2025) lists *Prompt Injection* as LLM01, with mitigations. citeturn2search3  
- **Risk governance:** NIST AI RMF profiles for GenAI provide lifecycle controls; adopt as org policy baseline. citeturn2search2turn2search5

### 4.2 Safeguarding methodology
- **Defense‑in‑depth:** hardened system prompts, input isolation/spotlighting, deny‑list/allow‑list tool policies, provenance checks, and red teaming (manual + automated). Microsoft’s recent guidance outlines multi‑layer controls for indirect injection. citeturn2search1turn2search14  
- **Red teaming & audits:** combine community, targeted, and automated red teaming; track findings to mitigations and re‑test. citeturn10search1

## 5) Verification & Evaluation

### 5.1 Benchmarks & protocols
- **HELM**: multi‑metric, multi‑scenario standardized runs; adopt its reporting format. citeturn0search7  
- **PromptBench / PromptRobust**: adversarial prompt robustness. citeturn3search8turn3search4  
- **GAIA**: agent/tool‑use benchmark with real‑world tasks; track exact‑match & tool cost. citeturn3search9  
- **Task staples**: MMLU (breadth), TruthfulQA (truthfulness), GSM8K (math reasoning). citeturn7search0turn7search1turn7search2

### 5.2 Validation templates
- **Experiment YAML** (single source of truth):
  ```yaml
  run_id: vesper-prompts-v1.3.0
  model: gpt-5-pro
  decoding: {temperature: 0.0, top_p: 1.0, max_tokens: 1024, n: 1}
  datasets: [helm:mmlu, rag:golden_set_v2, promptbench:adv_suite_v1]
  seeds: [17, 23, 43]
  metrics: [accuracy, exact_match, robustness@adv, latency_p50, cost]
  gates: {accuracy>=0.74, robustness@adv>=0.62, truthfulqa>=0.62}
  provenance: require_citations: true
  ```
- **Regression:** store baselines; on PR, auto‑run evals; fail if guardrails regress beyond tolerance.

### 5.3 Monitoring prompt drift
- Log prompt version, checksum, decoding params, model version; sample production traffic into periodic evals; alert on metric drift or increased refusal/error rates.

## 6) Documentation & Best Practices

- **Docs‑as‑code:** every prompt ships with intent, assumptions, expected failure modes, and eval deltas.  
- **CI/CD:** treat prompts as code—pre‑commit linters, schema checks, eval gates, and security scans.  
- **Multi‑vendor compatibility:** abstract providers behind a uniform client; mirror evals across vendors (OpenAI Evals, LM‑Eval‑Harness, LangSmith, promptfoo). citeturn10search0turn10search3turn8search10turn8search0  
- **RAG‑specific:** track retrieval quality and answer faithfulness with RAGAS/ARES in CI. citeturn8search5turn8search12
