# Algorithms Spec (Phase 2)

This directory contains deterministic, testable pseudocode for core algorithms, with pre/postâ€‘conditions, complexity, and failure modes. Fixtures in `../fixtures/` provide golden inputs/outputs. Numerical tolerances and SIMD feature flags are documented in `tolerances.md`.
